# Channels: EGC (Employee-Generated Content)

Guides EGC and employee advocacy strategy for AI/SaaS products. EGC is content created by employees (social posts, videos, blogs, testimonials) that reflects authentic workplace and product insights. Employee-shared content generates ~8x more engagement than brand posts; LinkedIn employee posts reach ~561% more than brand content.

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1-2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for product marketing context first:** If `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` or `.cursor/product-marketing-context.md` exists, read it for product, audience, and brand voice.

Identify:
1. **Goal**: Brand trust, thought leadership, recruitment, or conversion
2. **Platform**: LinkedIn (B2B primary), X, Instagram, TikTok
3. **Employee base**: Size, roles, existing social presence

## EGC vs. UGC vs. Creator Program

| Dimension | EGC | UGC | Creator Program |
|-----------|-----|-----|-----------------|
| **Source** | Employees | Customers | External creators |
| **Trust** | Company experts (66% vs 47% for ads) | Peer reviews | Influencer reach |
| **Cost** | Low; leverage workforce | Incentives, curation | Credits, payment |
| **Best for** | B2B, SaaS, professional services | Social proof, reviews | Content scale, tutorials |

## Why EGC Works

- **Algorithm favor**: Social platforms prioritize personal accounts over brand pages
- **Authenticity**: 92% trust recommendations from individuals over branded content; 81% need to trust before buying
- **B2B fit**: LinkedIn is primary; employees share industry expertise and product insights
- **Results**: 27% engagement increase, 19% sales increase in first year; 24% higher conversion vs traditional content

## Content Formats

| Format | Use | Platform |
|-------|-----|----------|
| **Day-in-the-life** | Culture, behind-the-scenes | LinkedIn, TikTok, Instagram |
| **Industry insights** | Thought leadership, expertise | LinkedIn |
| **Short-form video** | Quick tips, demos | TikTok, LinkedIn, Instagram |
| **Testimonials** | Product experience | Website, case studies |
| **Serialized content** | Consistent presence | Personal + brand accounts |

## Implementation Best Practices

**Do not force participation.** Recognize and nurture organic content from employees already sharing about work. Volunteer participation outperforms mandated programs.

| Practice | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Tiered framework** | Map employees by engagement (nano, micro, macro); treat like internal influencer tiers |
| **Brief templates** | Content objectives, brand voice, mandatory disclosures (FTC/ASA) |
| **Advocacy platforms** | Sociabble, EveryoneSocial for brief distribution and tracking |
| **Incentives** | Leaderboards, recognition; avoid heavy-handed quotas |
| **Training** | Improve quality and consistency; keep approval simple |
| **Centralized hub** | Branded hashtags, content library, approval workflow |

## B2B / SaaS Specifics

- **Cost-effective**: Leverage existing workforce vs hiring external creators
- **Diverse perspectives**: Sales, support, dev create varied content for different segments
