# Channels: Referral

Guides referral program strategy for AI/SaaS products. Leverage existing users to drive growth; 3%–5% conversion vs. 1%–2% for ads; CAC 50%–70% lower.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for product marketing context first:** If `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` or `.cursor/product-marketing-context.md` exists, read it for product, audience, and value proposition.

Identify:
1. **Product type**: SaaS, AI tool, subscription
2. **User base**: Size, engagement, retention
3. **Goal**: Signups, purchases, or both

## Referral vs. Affiliate vs. Influencer

| Dimension | Referral | Affiliate | Influencer |
|-----------|----------|-----------|------------|
| **Who** | Existing users | Professional promoters | KOLs |
| **Incentive** | Discounts, credits | Commission | Fees, product |
| **Barrier** | Low (all users) | Medium | High |
| **Conversion** | 3%–5% | Varies | Varies |

## Reward Models

| Model | Use |
|-------|-----|
| **Two-way** | Both referrer and referee get rewards; highest participation |
| **One-way** | Only referrer rewarded; cost control |
| **Tiered** | Rewards increase with referral count; incentivizes volume |

**Benchmark**: Rewards ~11% off or ~$21 value; weak incentives = low participation.

## Best Practices

- **Run multiple programs**: Target different audiences, stages, goals
- **Tiered rewards**: Motivate top performers; progressive incentives
- **Friction-free sharing**: Mobile-friendly; one-click share
- **Time-boxed incentives**: "Refer this week for $15 off" creates urgency
- **Placement**: Web, email, app, in-product touchpoints

## Tools

- **Cello**, **Impact**, **Viral Loops** for AI/SaaS
- **Tracking**: Unique links, UTM parameters

## Implementation

- **Landing page** or in-app feature with unique tracking links
- **Startup cost**: Typically hundreds for tools + dev
- **KPIs**: Referral rate, conversion, CAC, LTV of referred users

## Output Format

- **Reward model** recommendation
- **Placement** strategy
- **Tier structure** (if tiered)
- **Tool** selection
- **KPI** framework
