# Pages: Contact

Guides contact page design and form optimization for conversions.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for product marketing context first:** If `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` or `.cursor/product-marketing-context.md` exists, read it for brand voice.

Identify:
1. **Contact types**: Sales, support, general, press
2. **Form purpose**: Lead capture, support ticket, demo request
3. **Alternative channels**: Email, phone, chat, social

## Best Practices

### Form Design

| Principle | Guideline |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Short** | 3–5 fields for basic contact; long forms increase abandonment |
| **Single column** | Vertical layout; works better on mobile |
| **Logical grouping** | Name+email together; address fields together |
| **Required fields** | Mark clearly (asterisk); avoid surprises |
| **Progressive disclosure** | Show relevant fields based on selections |

### Field Labels

- **Clear language**: "Email Address" not "Email ID"
- **Conversational**: Friendly, welcoming
- **No jargon**: Universally understood terms

### CTA Button

- **Action verbs**: "Send Message," "Get in Touch," "Start a Conversation"
- **Avoid generic**: "Submit" → "Send Message"
- **Stand out**: Contrasting color, clear hierarchy

### Page-Level

| Element | Guideline |
|---------|-----------|
| **Visibility** | "Contact" or "Support" in main nav, not just footer |
| **Mobile** | Appropriate input types (tel for phone), large tap targets |
| **Proofreading** | No typos—credibility at conversion moment |
| **Alternatives** | Email, phone, chat if form isn't right |

### Trust

- **Response time**: "We reply within 24 hours"
- **Privacy**: Link to privacy policy near form
- **Security**: HTTPS, visible trust signals

## Output Format

- **Form** structure (fields, order)
- **Copy** (labels, placeholder, CTA)
- **Page** layout and placement
- **SEO** metadata
- **Accessibility** checklist
