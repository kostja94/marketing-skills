# Pages: Homepage

Guides homepage content, structure, and conversion optimization.

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1?2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for product marketing context first:** If `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` or `.cursor/product-marketing-context.md` exists, read it for product, audience, and value proposition.

Identify:
1. **Primary goal**: Sign up, demo, purchase, learn more
2. **Audience**: Cold visitors, returning, specific segment
3. **Traffic source**: Organic, paid, referral

## Homepage Structure

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Hero** | Value proposition, primary CTA, above the fold |
| **Social proof** | Logos, testimonials, metrics |
| **Features/Benefits** | What it does, why it matters |
| **Use cases** | Who it's for, how they use it |
| **Objection handling** | FAQ, guarantees, comparisons |
| **Final CTA** | Repeat primary action |

## Best Practices

### Value Proposition

- **Clarity**: Visitor understands in 5 seconds
- **Specificity**: Concrete benefit, not vague
- **Differentiation**: Why you, not alternatives
- **Customer language**: Their words, not jargon

### CTA

- One clear primary action
- Button copy: value-focused ("Start Free Trial") not generic ("Submit")
- Visible without scrolling
- Repeated at logical points

### SEO

- Unique title (50??0 chars) with primary keyword
- Meta description (150??60 chars) with CTA
- H1 = value proposition or primary headline
- Logical H2?H6 structure

## Output Format

- **Structure** outline (sections)
- **Hero** copy options (headline, subheadline, CTA)
- **Key sections** content suggestions
- **SEO** metadata (title, description, H1)
- **Conversion** checklist
