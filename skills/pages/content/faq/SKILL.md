# Pages: FAQ

Guides FAQ page content, structure, and optimization for SEO and conversion.

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1–2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for product marketing context first:** If `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` or `.cursor/product-marketing-context.md` exists, read it for objections, product details, and customer language.

Identify:
1. **Source of questions**: Support tickets, sales, chat, surveys
2. **Conversion focus**: Objection-handling, decision-support
3. **Placement**: Dedicated page, in-page sections, or both

## Best Practices

### Research Real Questions

- **Data-driven**: Support tickets, emails, live chat, social, surveys
- **Sales input**: Common objections from sales team
- **Customer service**: Top recurring questions
- **Avoid assumptions**: Don't invent questions

### Question Selection

- **Conversion-related**: Address objections, move toward purchase
- **Avoid irrelevant**: Skip company history, founder details unless asked
- **Match phrasing**: How customers naturally ask

### Answer Quality

- **Direct**: Solve the problem; no fluff
- **Conversational**: Avoid corporate jargon
- **Scannable**: Short paragraphs, bullet points
- **Complete**: Answer fully without requiring follow-up

### Organization

- **Categories**: Group by topic (Billing, Features, Support)
- **Hierarchy**: Clear sections, logical order
- **Navigation**: Table of contents, accordions, jump links

### SEO

- **Keywords**: Natural inclusion in Q&A
- **Title/meta**: Optimized for FAQ queries
- **Schema**: FAQPage structured data for rich snippets
- **Featured snippets**: Concise answers for "People Also Ask"

### Why It Matters

- Reduces support load
- Targets long-tail and voice search
- Can convert 2→x higher than standard content
- Builds trust; creates featured snippet opportunities

## Output Format

- **Question list** (from research)
- **Category** structure
- **Answer** format and tone
