# Pages: Features

Guides features page content, structure, and conversion optimization.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for product marketing context first:** If `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` or `.cursor/product-marketing-context.md` exists, read it for product, differentiation, and proof points.

Identify:
1. **Feature set**: Core features, differentiators
2. **Audience**: Who evaluates features (buyer persona)
3. **Format**: Single page vs. per-feature pages
4. **Primary goal**: Demo, sign up, learn more

## Features Page Structure

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Headline** | Benefit-led; "Everything you need to..." |
| **Feature grid/list** | Each feature: name, benefit, optional screenshot |
| **Use case links** | "For marketers," "For developers" |
| **Social proof** | Testimonials, logos |
| **CTA** | Try free, see demo, contact |

## Best Practices

### Benefit-First

- **Lead with benefit**: "Save 10 hours/week" not "Automated reporting"
- **Customer outcome**: What they get, not what it does
- **Specificity**: Numbers, examples, not vague claims

### Organization

- **By use case**: Group by job-to-be-done
- **By priority**: Most important/differentiating first
- **By journey**: Discovery → evaluation → decision

### Per-Feature Pages

- Use when features are substantial or rank separately
- Each page: feature name, benefit, how it works, proof
- Internal link from main features page

## SEO

- Title: "Features | [Product]" or "[Feature] | [Product]"
- H1: Main value; H2 per feature or section
- Schema: SoftwareApplication if applicable
- Internal links: To pricing, use cases, blog

## Output Format

- **Feature list** with benefit-first copy
- **Structure** (sections, order)
- **Headline** options
- **Per-feature** content (if separate pages)
- **SEO** metadata and schema
