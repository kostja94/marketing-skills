# Pages: Affiliate Program

Guides affiliate program page content and structure for conversion and quality affiliate signups.

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1-2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for product marketing context first:** If `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` or `.cursor/product-marketing-context.md` exists, read it for product, audience, and proof points.

Identify:
1. **Commission model**: Percentage, flat rate, recurring, one-time
2. **Target affiliates**: Bloggers, influencers, agencies, etc.
3. **Product fit**: Why affiliates would promote you

## Best Practices

### Four Key Questions Affiliates Ask

1. **How much can I earn?** ? Be specific upfront
2. **Is this product worth promoting?** ? Product value, audience fit
3. **Will I be set up for success?** ? Resources, support, tracking
4. **Can I trust you to pay me?** ? Payment terms, proof

### Commission Structure (Transparency)

| Item | Include |
|------|---------|
| Commission rate | Percentage or flat |
| Recurring vs. one-time | Duration of recurring |
| Cookie/tracking window | How long the cookie lasts |
| Minimum payout | Threshold to receive payment |
| Payment schedule | When payouts occur |
| Payment methods | PayPal, bank transfer, etc. |
| Refund/chargeback policy | How they affect commissions |

### Value Proposition

- **Specific numbers**: "Earn 30% recurring--up to $147/month per customer"
- **Earning calculator**: Help affiliates visualize income
- **Avoid vague**: "Great commissions" ? "30% recurring for 12 months"

### Product Information

Affiliates stake their reputation; convince them it's worth promoting:
- What it does (clear, jargon-free)
- Who it's for (audience, use cases)
- Why it's superior (differentiators)
- Social proof (customers, testimonials, logos)

### Design

- Treat like a product landing page--professional, engaging
- Same quality as main marketing pages

## Output Format

- **Headline** and value proposition
- **Commission** section structure
- **Product** summary for affiliates
- **FAQ** for common affiliate questions
- **CTA** and signup flow
