# Pages: Customer Stories

Guides customer story and case study page content, structure, and conversion.

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1?2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for product marketing context first:** If `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` or `.cursor/product-marketing-context.md` exists, read it for product, proof points, and customer language.

Identify:
1. **Story format**: Full case study, quote snippet, video
2. **Industries/use cases**: Who to showcase
3. **Metrics**: What results to highlight

## Best Practices

### Structure (Challenge ??Solution ??Results)

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Headline** | Benefit-driven; lead with outcome |
| **Challenge** | Client's problem, pain points |
| **Solution** | How your product helped |
| **Results** | Quantifiable metrics, before/after |
| **Quote** | Direct testimonial from client |
| **CTA** | Next step (demo, contact, read more) |

### Content Principles

- **Lead with results**: Outcomes first, not background
- **Specific metrics**: "Increased revenue 40%" not "great results"
- **Quotes**: Direct, attributed, credible
- **Scannable**: Consistent template; easy to skim
- **Concise**: Enough value without losing interest

### Visual Elements

- **Logos**: Client branding (with permission)
- **Charts/graphs**: Before-after, metrics
- **Video**: Testimonials, interviews
- **Expandable sections**: For deeper detail
