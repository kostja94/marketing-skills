# Pages: Media Kit

Guides media kit and press page content, structure, and accessibility for journalists. Media kits provide self-service brand assets; consistent presentation builds trust (companies with strong guidelines are 20% more valuable).

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1-2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for product marketing context first:** If `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` or `.cursor/product-marketing-context.md` exists, read it for company story, metrics, key messages, and Section 12 (Visual Identity).

Identify:
1. **Audience**: Journalists, bloggers, analysts
2. **Update frequency**: Before launches, events, announcements
3. **Assets**: Logos, brand guidelines, favicon, photos, videos

## Best Practices

### Essential Elements

**Evergreen content:**
- Company overview (background, mission, origin)
- Key team bios and headshots
- High-res logos (multiple sizes, light/dark backgrounds, transparent PNG)
- Brand guidelines document (typography, colors, logo usage)
- Key statistics (customers, growth, metrics)

**Regularly updated:**
- Recent press releases
- Product photos and video clips
- Press coverage and media mentions
- Contact for press inquiries

### Logo Assets (per Alignify-style media kit)

| Asset | Format | Use |
|-------|--------|-----|
| **Main logo** | PNG, SVG; light and dark bg | Primary branding |
| **Icon** | PNG; light and dark bg | Favicon, social, compact use |
| **Brand pattern** | PNG | Visual identity element |
| **Brand guidelines** | PDF or PNG | Typography, colors, usage rules |

### Usage Guidelines

**Allowed**: Media coverage, blog posts, social sharing, product comparisons, educational use. Assets free to download without additional authorization.

**Requirements**: Maintain logo proportions and colors; ensure adequate white space; do not use in contexts that harm brand. For commercial or special use, contact for authorization.

### Structure
