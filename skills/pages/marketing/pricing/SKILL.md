# Pages: Pricing

Guides pricing page content, structure, and conversion optimization.

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1–2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for product marketing context first:** If `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` or `.cursor/product-marketing-context.md` exists, read it for product, audience, and pricing strategy.

Identify:
1. **Pricing model**: Subscription, one-time, usage-based, freemium
2. **Plans**: Number of tiers, differentiation
3. **Primary goal**: Sign up, contact sales, trial
4. **Objections**: Price sensitivity, "which plan?" confusion

## Pricing Page Structure

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Headline** | Value-focused; "Simple pricing" or benefit-led |
| **Plan comparison** | Clear table or cards; feature comparison |
| **FAQ** | Common objections (billing, cancellation, refunds) |
| **Social proof** | Testimonials, logos, "X companies trust us" |
| **CTA** | Per plan or unified "Get started" |
| **Guarantee** | Money-back, free trial, no credit card |

## Best Practices

### Plan Presentation

- **Anchoring**: Lead with mid-tier or annual discount
- **Differentiation**: Clear "most popular" or "best value"
- **Feature clarity**: What's included; avoid vague "Advanced features"
- **Comparison**: Help user choose (quiz, comparison table)

### Objection Handling

- **Price**: ROI, cost per use, comparison to alternatives
- **Commitment**: Free trial, no CC, cancel anytime
- **Uncertainty**: Guarantee, case studies, support

### SEO

- Title: "Pricing | [Product]" or "Plans & Pricing"
- Meta: Include price range or "Start free" if applicable
- Schema: Consider Product/Offer structured data

## Output Format

- **Headline** options
- **Plan structure** (tiers, features, pricing display)
- **FAQ** topics and sample answers
- **CTA** copy per plan
- **Objection handling** copy
- **SEO** metadata
