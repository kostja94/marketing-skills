# Pages: Services

Guides services page content and structure for service-based businesses (consulting, agencies, freelancers).

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1?2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for product marketing context first:** If `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` or `.cursor/product-marketing-context.md` exists, read it for service offerings and differentiation.

Identify:
1. **Service count**: One overview or multiple service pages
2. **Audience**: B2B, B2C, or both
3. **Conversion goal**: Contact, quote, booking

## Best Practices

### Structure

| Approach | When |
|----------|------|
| **Single page** | Few services; compact overview |
| **Hub + detail** | Many services; main page links to each |
| **Service tiers** | Packages, pricing tiers |

### Essential Elements

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Service overview** | What you offer; who it's for |
| **Benefits** | Outcomes, not just features |
| **Process** | How you work; steps |
| **Proof** | Case studies, testimonials |
| **CTA** | Contact, get quote, book call |

### Content

- **Benefit-first**: Solve problems; outcomes
- **Clear scope**: What's included
- **Differentiation**: Why you vs. others

### SEO

- Target "service + location" or "service + industry"
- Schema: Service type
- Internal links from Home, About

## Output Format

- **Structure** (single vs. hub)
- **Service** descriptions
- **CTA** placement
- **SEO** metadata
