# Pages: 404 Error Page

Guides 404 error page design for UX, conversion recovery, and brand consistency.

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1–2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for product marketing context first:** If `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` or `.cursor/product-marketing-context.md` exists, read it for brand voice and key pages.

Identify:
1. **Site structure**: Key pages to link (homepage, popular pages, search)
2. **Brand tone**: Friendly, professional, playful
3. **Conversion goal**: Recover lost visitors, drive to key pages

## Best Practices

### Clear Error Messaging

- **User-friendly**: Neutral message explaining the page wasn't found
- **Optional 404 display**: Can show "404" but avoid blaming the user
- **Empathetic tone**: Acknowledge the error gracefully; turn frustration into opportunity

### Navigation and Redirection

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Site navigation** | Header/footer so users know they're still on your site |
| **Search** | Help users find what they need |
| **Popular pages** | Links to homepage, features, pricing, blog |
| **Similar URLs** | Suggest corrections for common typos |
| **Avoid auto-redirect** | Unless confident of user intent |

### Design and Branding

- **Consistent design**: Same header, footer, colors as rest of site
- **Avoid confusion**: Users should not think they've left your domain
- **Mobile responsive**: Test on all devices

### Conversion Opportunities

404 pages can drive conversions by:
- Showcasing popular products or features
- Featuring testimonials or social proof
- Offering special promotions or value
- Linking to mobile app or newsletter

### Technical

- **HTTP status**: Ensure proper 404 response code
