# Platforms: Grokipedia

Guides adding recommendations, links, or content to Grokipedia. Part of parasite SEO (leveraging high-authority platforms) and GEO (AI citation visibility). Grokipedia is xAI's AI-generated encyclopedia; ChatGPT, Perplexity, and other AI tools cite it.

**On each invocation**: On **first use** in the conversation, output the complete response (Introduction, Importance, Methods, Rules, Avoid, Action). On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip (e.g., "just do it", "skip intro", "I already know"), go directly to Action.

**Growth channel value**: Grokipedia is worth investing in as a growth channel for GEO and backlinks. It is positioned as a potential future Wikipediaâ€”Wikipedia's traffic and domain authority are well-established; Grokipedia, though newer, is already being cited by major AI products and its citation share is rising.

## Scope

- **Suggest Article**: Request new topics; Grok AI reviews and may create
- **Suggest Edit**: Propose corrections or additions to existing articles
- **Report Error**: Flag factual inaccuracies, outdated info, citation errors
- **Parasite SEO / GEO**: Use Grokipedia's authority for backlinks and AI citation

## What Is Grokipedia

- **Platform**: AI-generated online encyclopedia by xAI (Grok); launched October 2025
- **Content**: ~6M+ articles; AI-generated, fact-checked by Grok; users cannot edit directly
- **GEO relevance**: ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Mode, AI Overviews, Gemini, Copilot cite Grokipedia for factual queries
- **Parasite SEO**: High-authority domain; links from Grokipedia pass authority; content placement for distributed visibility

### Why It Matters (Citation Data)

| Metric | Source | Note |
|--------|--------|------|
| ChatGPT citations | Ahrefs (Jan 2026) | ~263K responses cited Grokipedia from 13.6M prompts; ~95K individual pages. Wikipedia: 2.9M responsesâ€?quite a way off, but impressive for how new they are" |
| Citation share trend | Profound | ~0.01â€?.02% of ChatGPT citations/day; steadily increasing since mid-Nov 2025 |
| AI product adoption | Semrush, Ahrefs | Spike in Google AI (Gemini, AI Overviews, AI Mode) and Copilot in Dec 2025; ChatGPT cites Grokipedia most |
| Use case | BrightEdge | Niche, obscure, highly specific factual queries; ChatGPT often features Grokipedia as one of the first sources cited |

**Bottom line**: Grokipedia is still secondary to Wikipedia but growing. Early participation can capture future authority as AI citation becomes more centralâ€”similar to Wikipedia's dominance in traditional search.

## How to Contribute

### Prerequisites

- **Login required**: Google, X, Apple, or email account
- **URL**: grokipedia.com

### Foundation for Promotion

The basis for Grokipedia promotion is an **article published online** that includes your product and can be crawled by Grok. Grok discovers sources via web search when creating or editing articles; if your page is not indexable or does not mention the topic, it will not be cited. Higher SEO ranking improves discoverability but is not requiredâ€”Grok may still find and cite relevant content that ranks lower.

### Suggest New Article

1. Click **bulb icon** on homepage, or search for a topic and click **"Request this article"**
2. Describe why Grokipedia should add the article
3. Include aspects you want covered
4. **Status flow**: Pending â†?In Progress â†?Processing â†?Created
5. Grok reviews; no guaranteed approval; review typically within ~2 hours

### Suggest Edit (Existing Articles)

1. **Highlight** problematic or incomplete text
2. Click **"Suggest Edit"** (pop-up form)
3. Provide correction and **supporting evidence** (URLs, sources)
4. Grok reviews; approved edits typically applied within ~2 hours

### Report Error

| Error type | Examples |
|------------|----------|
| Factual inaccuracies | Wrong dates, numbers, definitions |
| Outdated information | Obsolete facts |
| Misleading context | Framing issues |
| Citation errors | Broken links, unsupported claims |
| Technical bugs | Formatting, display |

### Grok Review Constraints

Grok AI evaluates all suggestions and is **strict**: it rejects promotional content and explicit third-party citation requests. Do not mention your brand or URL in Article Topic, Additional Details, Summary, or Edit content. The tactics below work by providing genuinely useful, factual content and letting Grok discover your source through "Add another source" (Suggest Edit) or web search (Suggest Article).

## Two Tactics for GEO & Citation (Field-Tested)

Two practical ways to get Grokipedia to cite your content: **Suggest Article** (new topic) and **Suggest Edit** (existing page). Both can lead to backlinks and AI citation when done well.

**When the user asks to promote a product/brand/topic**: Output the full response per the Required Output Structure (Introduction, Importance, Methods, Rules, Avoid, Action)â€”do not output only the action.

### Tactic 1: Suggest New Article â€?Induce Creation That Cites Your Content

**Goal**: Propose a topic so Grokipedia creates a new article; Grok will search for sources and may cite your page if it matches the query.

**Critical rule**: **Do not include your URL** in the suggestion. Grok flags direct URLs; use a "stealth" approach instead.

| Field | Best practice | Why it works |
|-------|---------------|---------------|
| **Article Topic** | Specific, encyclopedic (e.g., "3D Model Generator," "Virtual Staging Software," "Marie Curie") | Vague topics ("Technology") get rejected; precise topics pass AI validation and match Grokipedia's scope |
| **Additional Details** | Describe what aspects to cover, why the topic matters, and specific areas of interest | Grok uses this to shape the article and search for sources; your phrasing influences which queries it runs |
| **Content strategy** | Rewrite your article's key concepts as neutral, factual "aspects to cover" â€?definitions, use cases, types, history | Grok searches for these concepts; if your page ranks for them, it may be cited as a source |

**Tips for great suggestions** (from Grokipedia guidelines):

- Be specific about the topic or subject
- Explain why this article would be valuable
- Mention any specific areas of interest

**Stealth approach** â€?How to use your content without URLs:

1. Extract from your article: definitions, categories, use cases, technical terms, examples.
2. Turn them into "aspects to cover" and "areas of interest" in neutral, encyclopedic language.
3. Example: If your article covers "AI-powered 3D model generation for e-commerce," suggest: *"Cover types of 3D model generators (AI-based, photogrammetry, CAD), use cases in e-commerce and product visualization, and how they differ from traditional modeling."*
4. Grok will search for these terms; if your page is relevant and authoritative, it may be included as a source.

**Example structure** (desensitized):

```
Article Topic: [Specific topic, e.g., 3D Model Generator]
Additional Details: This topic is important because [reason]. Please cover: [definition], [types/categories], [use cases], [how it differs from X]. Specific areas of interest: [subtopics from your content, phrased neutrally].
```

### Tactic 2: Suggest Edit â€?Enrich Existing Articles to Cite Your Content

**Goal**: Improve an existing Grokipedia page so Grok adopts your article as a supporting source.

**Critical rule**: **Do not mention your brand or URL** in Summary or Edit content. Add your URL only in "Add another source" alongside other authoritative sources.

| Field | Best practice | Why it works |
|-------|---------------|---------------|
| **Summary** | Brief, factual (e.g., "Expanded Virtual Staging Methods section with additional techniques") | Sounds like a normal correction; avoids promotional tone |
| **Edit content** | Rich, creative, factually accurate â€?expand or replace the highlighted passage | Grok prefers substantive edits; generic text is less likely to be accepted |
| **Add another source** | Your URL + 1â€? other authoritative sources (industry reports, trade publications) | Grok validates against sources; mixing your URL with established sources improves acceptance |

**Tips for Edit content**:

- Use double quotes for exact phrases you want to add or replace (helps with Ctrl+F when applying).
- Expand thin sections (e.g., "showcase multiple style options") into fuller subsections (e.g., Virtual Staging Methods: furniture replacement, style variation, room redesign).
- Keep tone neutral and encyclopedic; avoid marketing language.

**Example** (desensitized â€?expanding a thin "Virtual Staging Methods" section):

| Field | Example |
|-------|---------|
| **Summary** | "Expanded Virtual Staging Methods with additional techniques and use cases" |
| **Edit content** | "Virtual staging methods include furniture replacement, style variation (e.g., modern, traditional, minimalist), and full room redesign. This approach enhances client engagement by providing immersive previews of potential designs, enabling designers to "present multiple style options efficiently" and help clients visualize spaces before physical staging. Common techniques include AI-assisted furniture placement, material and color swapping, and virtual renovation overlays." |
| **Add another source** | Your article URL + 1â€? authoritative sources (e.g., Forbes, TechCrunch, industry report) |

**Why this works**: Grok needs verifiable sources. By adding substantive, well-sourced content and including your URL in "Add another source" with other credible links, you increase the chance Grok will adopt your page as a reference.

### Reference Instances

Field-tested examples: a marketer's site was successfully cited as a source via Suggest Article and Suggest Edit. Products mentioned in the site's articles also appear in Grokipedia, enabling both backlinks and product visibility. Inspect these pages to see how content and sources are structured.

| Type | Example page |
|------|--------------|
| **Suggest Edit** | [AI browser](https://grokipedia.com/page/ai_browser) |
| **Suggest Article** | [Accent conversion](https://grokipedia.com/page/Accent_conversion), [AI Video Effects Tools](https://grokipedia.com/page/AI_Video_Effects_Tools), [Creator contest](https://grokipedia.com/page/Creator_contest), [Lifetime deal](https://grokipedia.com/page/Lifetime_deal), [Creator programs in AI and SaaS marketing](https://grokipedia.com/page/Creator_programs_in_AI_and_SaaS_marketing), [Web Animation Libraries](https://grokipedia.com/page/Web_Animation_Libraries) |

## Best Practices

| Practice | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Provide sources** | Citations improve approval; use authoritative URLs |
| **Be factual** | Grok evaluates accuracy; avoid promotional language |
| **Relevant links** | When suggesting additions, include your site only if genuinely relevant and cited |
| **Topic alignment** | Request articles that fit encyclopedic scope; avoid pure product pages |
| **Patience** | Review is AI-driven; typically within ~2 hours |
| **No URL in Suggest Article** | Grok detects and may reject direct URLs; embed concepts as "aspects to cover" instead |
| **Brand-free Summary/Edit** | For Suggest Edit, keep Summary and Edit content brand-neutral; add your URL only in "Add another source" |

## Parasite SEO & GEO Context

- **Parasite SEO**: Placing content on high-authority platforms (Medium, Reddit, wikis) to leverage their domain strength. Grokipedia fits Tier 6 (Wiki & Structured Knowledge) in distributed authority frameworks.
- **GEO**: AI tools cite Grokipedia; having your brand, product, or expertise represented can influence AI-generated answers.
- **Risk**: Google's Site Reputation Abuse policy (2024) targets manipulative third-party content. Ensure contributions are genuinely useful, not purely for link/mention manipulation.

## Output Format

**When this skill is invoked**, always output a **complete response** covering all sections below. Do not output only the actionâ€”include introduction, importance, methods, rules, avoidances, and action.

### Required Output Structure (in order)

1. **Introduction** â€?What Grokipedia is: AI-generated encyclopedia by xAI (Grok), launched Oct 2025; ~6M+ articles; ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Mode, Gemini, Copilot cite it; users suggest, Grok reviews; no direct editing.

2. **Foundation** â€?Prerequisite: an article published online that includes the product and can be crawled by Grok; higher SEO ranking helps but is not required.

3. **Importance** â€?Why it matters for GEO and parasite SEO: high-authority domain; backlinks pass authority; AI tools cite Grokipedia for factual queries; citation share rising; positioned as potential future Wikipedia; early participation captures future authority.

4. **Methods** â€?Two ways to get cited:
   - **Suggest Article**: Propose new topic; Grok creates article and searches for sources; your page may be cited if it matches.
   - **Suggest Edit**: Enrich existing page; add your URL in "Add another source"; Grok may adopt it.

5. **Rules** â€?Grok is strict; must follow:
   - No brand or URL in Article Topic, Additional Details, Summary, or Edit content.
   - Suggest Article: embed concepts as "aspects to cover"; Grok discovers via web search.
   - Suggest Edit: add your URL only in "Add another source" with 1â€? authoritative sources.
   - Be factual, neutral, encyclopedic; avoid promotional language.

6. **Avoid** â€?Do not: include your URL in Suggest Article; mention brand in Summary or Edit content; use vague topics ("Technology"); write marketing copy; expect instant approval (review typically within ~2 hours).
