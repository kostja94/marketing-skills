# Platforms: LinkedIn

Guides LinkedIn post copy creation and optimization. Use for generating publish-ready professional content. Suitable for copy agents and design agents (image specs).

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1–2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## Output: Publish-Ready Copy

This skill enables agents to generate LinkedIn post copy optimized for engagement. Output includes character-counted text and structure for the "See more" threshold.

## Character Limits

| Type | Limit | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| **Post** | 3,000 characters | Optimal: 1,300→,600 |
| **First line (critical)** | 210–235 chars | Visible before "See more"; 60–80% decide here |
| **Short posts** | 100→00 chars | Polls, announcements, quotes |

## Optimal Length by Content Type

| Type | Characters | Use |
|------|------------|-----|
| **Short** | 100→00 | Polls, announcements, quotes |
| **Medium** | 300→,200 | Case studies, tips, BTS |
| **Long** | 1,200→,000 | Thought leadership, analysis |
| **Sweet spot** | 1,300→,600 | Highest engagement |
| **Avoid** | >2,000 | ~35% engagement drop |

## First Line (Hook)

- **Place key message in first 140 chars**
- **Strong openings**: Specific results, pain points, bold claims, surprising stats
- **Avoid**: Vague teases, hashtag-first, generic greetings

## Image Specs (for Design Agents)

| Format | Dimensions | Use |
|--------|------------|-----|
| **Single image** | 1200×627 (1.91:1) | Feed; link previews |
| **Square** | 1200×1200 | Single image |
| **Carousel** | Up to 20 images | Multi-image post |
| **File** | →MB; JPG/PNG | Native uploads perform better |
| **Vertical** | Preferred | 88% browse on mobile |

## Best Practices

- **Mobile-first**: 88% users on mobile
- **Polls & PDFs**: Highest reach
- **Post frequency**: Weekly minimum for companies
- **Alt text**: Add for accessibility

## Output Format

When generating LinkedIn copy, provide:

1. **First line** (→10 chars; hook)
2. **Full post** with character count
3. **Hashtags** (3→; end of post)
4. **Image specs** (if design agent needs dimensions)
