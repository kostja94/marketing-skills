# Platforms: Reddit

Guides Reddit post and comment creation. Use for generating publish-ready posts that follow subreddit norms. Suitable for copy agents. Design agents can use for image post context.

## Output: Publish-Ready Copy

This skill enables agents to generate Reddit post copy (title + body) that respects platform rules and community culture. Output is subreddit-aware and engagement-optimized.

## Core Rules

| Rule | Practice |
|------|----------|
| **90/10 principle** | 90% value, 10% promotional |
| **Self-promotion** | Max 1 in 6 posts promotional |
| **Subreddit rules** | Always check sidebar before posting |
| **Flair** | Required by many subs; wrong flair = removal |
| **Title format** | Some subs require [tags]; check top posts |

## Post Structure

### Title

- **Concise, specific, accurate**—no clickbait
- Match subreddit format (e.g., [Discussion], [Question])
- Factual; save opinions for body/comments

### Body

- **Value-first**: Lead with help, insight, or story
- **Casual, friendly tone**—like talking to a friend
- **Engagement**: Open-ended questions, invite discussion
- **Formatting**: Markdown supported; use lists, headers for readability

## Content Types

| Type | Use |
|------|-----|
| **Experience sharing** | Highest engagement; authentic stories |
| **Q&A** | Build trust; answer questions |
| **Case study** | Product value; must be transparent |
| **Tool recommendation** | Context + honest pros/cons |

## Algorithm Factors

- **Upvote/downvote ratio** matters more than raw score
- **Early engagement** weighs more; post at peak hours
- **Karma**: 100–500+ recommended before promotional posts
- **Author interaction**: Reply to comments; boosts ranking

## Formatting (Markdown)

- **Bold**: `**text**`
- **Italic**: `*text*`
- **Lists**: `-` or `1.`
- **Links**: `[text](url)`

## Output Format

When generating Reddit copy, provide:

1. **Title** (subreddit-appropriate)
2. **Body** (value-driven, formatted)
3. **Suggested flair** (if known)
4. **Subreddit reminder**: "Verify rules before posting"
