# Platforms: TikTok

Guides TikTok caption and video script creation. Use for generating publish-ready captions and video specs. Suitable for copy agents, video agents (format, length), and design agents (thumbnail).

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1-2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## Output: Publish-Ready Copy

This skill enables agents to generate TikTok captions and video scripts. Captions drive SEO, accessibility, and watch time (12-20% increase with captions). 80%+ watch without sound.

## Caption Structure

| Element | Length | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Hook** | 5-7 words | Grab attention; create curiosity |
| **Context** | 1-2 sentences | Size, price, backstory--info video doesn't show |
| **CTA** | Optional | "Save this," "Link in bio" |

**Hook examples**: "Stop scrolling if you sell on Etsy," "This took me 47 attempts," "Wait for the final result"

## Video Specs (for Video Agents)

| Spec | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| **Aspect ratio** | 9:16 (portrait) | Standard; fills mobile |
| **Resolution** | 1080x1920 px | Recommended |
| **Length** | 3 sec - 10 min | 15-60 sec for tips; 1-3 min for tutorials |
| **Format** | MP4, MOV | H.264, AAC |
| **File size** | <=5MB (Android), <=88MB (iOS) | Varies by device |

## Caption Best Practices

- **Contrast**: Strong font/background contrast; 75% watch mute
- **Auto-captions**: TikTok's built-in; algorithm rewards; edit for accuracy
- **Keywords**: Improve search visibility
- **Readability**: Test on multiple devices

## Content by Length

| Length | Use |
|--------|-----|
| **15-60 sec** | Quick tips, humor, hooks |
| **1-3 min** | Tutorials, storytelling |
| **3-10 min** | Deep dives (longer format) |

## Output Format

When generating TikTok content, provide:

1. **Caption** (hook + context + CTA)
2. **Video script** (if video agent)
3. **Video specs** (9:16, 1080x1920, length)
4. **Hashtags** (3-5; niche-relevant)
