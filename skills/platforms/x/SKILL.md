# Platforms: X (Twitter)

Guides X post copy creation and optimization. Use for generating publish-ready posts, threads, and content that performs on X. Suitable for copy agents, design agents (image specs), and video agents (video post specs).

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1–2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## Output: Publish-Ready Copy

This skill enables agents to generate X post copy that can be published directly. Output includes character-counted text, thread structure, and platform-compliant formatting.

## Character Limits

| Type | Limit | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| **Standard post** | 280 characters | Most users |
| **Premium** | 25,000 characters | X Premium subscribers |
| **URL** | Counts as 23 chars | t.co shortens all links |
| **Emoji** | ~2 chars each | Varies by emoji |

## Optimal Lengths (Engagement)

| Use Case | Characters | Purpose |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **General** | 71→00 | Sweet spot for engagement |
| **Promotional** | 120→30 | Product/offer posts |
| **Question** | 60→0 | Drive replies |
| **Retweet-friendly** | →16 | Leaves room for "RT @user:" |

## Thread Format

- **Structure**: 3→ connected posts; number as 1/5, 2/5, etc.
- **First post**: Strong hook; no "thread" in first line
- **Last post**: CTA, summary, or question
- **Each post**: →80 chars; can stand alone

## Algorithm Tips (Grok AI)

| Signal | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Replies** | Highest weight (~54→5× likes); quality > quantity |
| **Author replies** | Active reply chains boost visibility ~75× |
| **Media** | Images/video boost ~2× |
| **External links** | Reduce score ~50%; prefer internal references |
| **Post limit** | 5→/day; >10/day reduces later visibility ~80% |

**Content**: Open questions, controversial views, stories; avoid "RT if agree" bait.

## Image Specs (for Design Agents)

| Format | Dimensions | Use |
|-------|------------|-----|
| **Single image** | 1200×675 (16:9) | Best visibility; no crop |
| **Square** | 800×800 | Single image |
| **Profile** | 400×400 | Avatar |
| **Header** | 1500×500 (3:1) | Banner |
| **File** | →MB; JPG/PNG | Over 5MB may compress |

## Output Format

When generating X copy, provide:

1. **Post text** with character count
2. **Hashtags** (if used; 1→ recommended)
3. **Thread structure** (if thread)
4. **Image specs** (if design agent needs dimensions)
