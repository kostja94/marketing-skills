# SEO Content: Content Strategy

Guides content strategy for SEO: content clusters, pillar pages, and editorial planning.

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1–2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for product marketing context first:** If `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` or `.cursor/product-marketing-context.md` exists, read it for product, audience, and proof points.

Identify:
1. **Keywords**: From keyword research
2. **Existing content**: What already exists
3. **Resources**: Content capacity, tools
4. **Goals**: Traffic, conversions, authority

## Content Cluster Model

### Pillar + Cluster

```
Pillar page (broad topic)
→? Cluster 1 (subtopic)
→? Cluster 2 (subtopic)
→? Cluster 3 (subtopic)
→? Cluster 4 (subtopic)
```

- **Pillar**: Comprehensive guide covering broad topic; targets head term
- **Clusters**: Detailed articles on subtopics; targets long-tail; links to pillar
- **Internal links**: Clusters →pillar; related clusters

### Example

- **Pillar**: "SEO Guide" (targets "SEO")
- **Clusters**: "Technical SEO," "On-Page SEO," "Link Building," "Content SEO"

## Content Types

| Type | Use |
|------|-----|
| **How-to guides** | Informational intent; high share potential |
| **Comparisons** | Commercial intent; "X vs Y" |
| **List posts** | "Top 10," "Best X" |
| **Glossaries** | Definition queries; internal link hub |
| **Tools/calculators** | Linkable assets; engagement |
| **Case studies** | Proof; conversion support |

## Editorial Calendar

- Map keywords to content pieces
- Prioritize by opportunity (volume × intent × feasibility)
- Schedule by capacity
- Include update schedule for existing content

## Output Format

- **Content cluster** map (pillar + clusters)
- **Content calendar** (topics, keywords, deadlines)
- **Internal linking** plan
- **Update plan** for existing content
