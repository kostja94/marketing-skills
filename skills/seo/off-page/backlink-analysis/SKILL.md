# SEO Off-Page: Backlink Analysis

Guides backlink profile analysis: assessing quality, identifying issues, and planning improvements.

## Scope (Off-Page SEO)

- **Backlink audit**: Analyze profile; toxic links; competitive analysis
- **Authority Score**: Monitor domain/page authority; referring domains

## Initial Assessment

Identify:
1. **Domain**: Site to analyze
2. **Tool access**: Ahrefs, Moz, Semrush, or free alternatives
3. **Goals**: Audit for issues, competitive analysis, or growth planning

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Referring domains** | Number of unique sites linking |
| **Backlinks** | Total number of links |
| **Domain Rating (DR) / Domain Authority (DA)** | Domain strength score |
| **Anchor text distribution** | Mix of branded, generic, exact match |
| **Link velocity** | Rate of new links over time |

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Quality Assessment

- **Relevance**: Do links come from related niches?
- **Authority**: Are referring domains trusted?
- **Context**: Editorial vs. footer/sidebar links?
- **Anchor text**: Natural or over-optimized?

### 2. Risk Signals

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Toxic links** | Consider disavow (use cautiously) |
| **Spammy anchors** | Diversify anchor text naturally |
| **Link schemes** | Remove or disavow |
| **Sudden spike** | Investigate; may trigger penalty |

### 3. Competitive Comparison

- Compare backlink profile to competitors
- Identify link gaps (sites linking to competitors but not you)
- Find link opportunities from competitor backlinks

## Disavow File

- Use only when necessary (manual penalty, toxic links)
- Submit via Google Search Console
- **Caution**: Over-disavowing can harm; use sparingly
