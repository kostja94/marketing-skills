## Initial Assessment

**Check for product marketing context first:** If `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` or `.cursor/product-marketing-context.md` exists, read it for product, audience, and proof points.

Identify:
1. **Current backlink profile**: Domain authority, referring domains
2. **Target keywords**: What to rank for
3. **Linkable assets**: Research, tools, guides, data, testimonials
