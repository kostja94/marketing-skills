# Strategies: GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)

Guides GEO/AEO strategy for AI search visibility. GEO optimizes content for ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Google AI Mode?getting cited in AI-generated answers rather than ranking in traditional SERPs.

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1–2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## Scope

- **GEO** = Generative Engine Optimization
- **AEO** = Answer Engine Optimization
- **LLMO** = Large Language Model Optimization
- **AIO** = Artificial Intelligence Optimization

All refer to the same goal: visibility in AI assistant responses.

## GEO vs. SEO

| Dimension | SEO | GEO |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| **Goal** | Rankings in search results | Citations in AI answers |
| **User path** | Click →visit →convert | Answer in-place; may not visit |
| **Content** | Full page optimization | Clear, citable paragraphs |
| **Metrics** | Clicks, traffic | Citations, brand mentions |
| **Platforms** | Google, Bing | ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity |

**Both matter**: Create content that ranks and gets cited.

## How GEO Works

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: AI tools search first, then generate answers. Optimize for search result performance to influence AI responses.
- **Search APIs**: Bing, Brave, etc. feed AI tools. SEO fundamentals still apply.
- **Core model training**: Long, costly; not practical for most strategies. Focus on RAG.

## Content Best Practices

| Practice | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Direct-answer format** | Answer specific questions in clear paragraphs |
| **Entity signals** | Clear brand, product, author identity |
| **Citable paragraphs** | Each block understandable on its own |
| **Distribution** | Website, YouTube, forums, Reddit?thoughtful comments can outrank blog posts |

## Parasite SEO & High-Authority Platforms

**Parasite SEO** = Placing content on high-authority platforms to leverage their domain strength for rankings and AI citation. Part of "Distributed Authority Engineering."

| Platform type | Examples | GEO relevance |
|---------------|----------|---------------|
| **Wiki / structured knowledge** | Wikipedia, Grokipedia, Wikihow | Very high AI citation; long-term authority |
| **Community** | Reddit, Quora | High; conversational, experience-based |
| **Publishing** | Medium, LinkedIn, Substack | High; thought leadership |
| **Technical** | GitHub, Stack Overflow | Very high; expertise signals |

**Grokipedia**: xAI's AI encyclopedia; ChatGPT, Perplexity, Copilot cite it. See platforms-grokipedia for adding recommendations or links. Contribute genuinely useful content; avoid manipulative placement (Google Site Reputation Abuse policy).
