# Strategies: GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)

Guides GEO/AEO strategy for AI search visibility. GEO optimizes content for ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Google AI Mode—getting cited in AI-generated answers rather than ranking in traditional SERPs.

## Scope

- **GEO** = Generative Engine Optimization
- **AEO** = Answer Engine Optimization
- **LLMO** = Large Language Model Optimization
- **AIO** = Artificial Intelligence Optimization

All refer to the same goal: visibility in AI assistant responses.

## GEO vs. SEO

| Dimension | SEO | GEO |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| **Goal** | Rankings in search results | Citations in AI answers |
| **User path** | Click → visit → convert | Answer in-place; may not visit |
| **Content** | Full page optimization | Clear, citable paragraphs |
| **Metrics** | Clicks, traffic | Citations, brand mentions |
| **Platforms** | Google, Bing | ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity |

**Both matter**: Create content that ranks and gets cited.

## How GEO Works

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: AI tools search first, then generate answers. Optimize for search result performance to influence AI responses.
- **Search APIs**: Bing, Brave, etc. feed AI tools. SEO fundamentals still apply.
- **Core model training**: Long, costly; not practical for most strategies. Focus on RAG.

## Content Best Practices

| Practice | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Direct-answer format** | Answer specific questions in clear paragraphs |
| **Entity signals** | Clear brand, product, author identity |
| **Citable paragraphs** | Each block understandable on its own |
| **Distribution** | Website, YouTube, forums, Reddit—thoughtful comments can outrank blog posts |

## Tools

- **Profound**, **Amplift**, **Daydream** for GEO tracking and optimization
