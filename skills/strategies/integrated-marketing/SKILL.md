# Strategies: Integrated Marketing (IMC)

Guides Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC) strategy. IMC coordinates all marketing channels to deliver a consistent message and unified customer experience. Companies using integrated approaches achieve ~25% higher marketing ROI; optimized channel mixes outperform by ~27% in acquisition efficiency.

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1-2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## Program vs. Channel vs. Campaign

| Term | Definition | Examples |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Program** | High-level strategy; collection of channels to achieve a discrete goal | Thought leadership program, lifecycle program, loyalty program |
| **Channel** | Specific medium/platform for communication | Email, LinkedIn, SEO, paid ads, events |
| **Campaign** | Time-bound initiative using one or more channels | Product launch, seasonal sale, holiday giveaway |

**Relationship**: Program contains campaigns; campaigns use channels. Avoid using terms interchangeably.

## PESO Model

Organize communications into four integrated categories:

| Type | Examples | Role |
|------|----------|------|
| **Paid** | Ads, sponsored content, influencer partnerships | Immediate reach, targeting |
| **Earned** | PR, media coverage, organic mentions | Authority, credibility |
| **Shared** | Social engagement, co-created content, EGC | Community, authenticity |
| **Owned** | Website, blog, email, content hub | Strategic foundation; anchor |

**Best practice**: Owned media as anchor; sequence PESO intentionally. Integration over silos--all four work together for synergy.

## Channel Evaluation Framework

When selecting channels, evaluate across:

| Variable | Question |
|---------|----------|
| **Goal** | Awareness, acquisition, loyalty? |
| **Cost** | Budget; CAC vs LTV |
| **Measurability** | Can you attribute impact? ROI clarity? |
| **Speed** | Time to full impact |
| **Scale** | How big can this channel get? |
| **Fit** | Does target audience use it? |
| **Effort** | Resources to set up and maintain |

## Example Programs

| Program | Channels | Goal |
|---------|----------|------|
| **Thought leadership** | PR, social, influencers, spokespeople, events | Brand authority |
| **Lifecycle** | Email, website chat, retargeting, SMS | Conversion, retention |
| **Loyalty** | Email campaigns, promotions, personalized offers | Retention |
| **Brand awareness** | Content marketing, influencer partnerships, PR | Reach |

## IMC Best Practices

- **Message consistency**: Same core message across channels; adapt for each medium
- **Start focused**: 2-3 connected channels first; prove ROI before expanding
- **Map to funnel**: Assign channels to awareness, consideration, decision
- **Unified measurement**: Single framework tracking shared goals; avoid channel-only reporting
- **Cross-channel attribution**: Link channels to determine true performance

## Output Format

- **Program** definition and goal
- **Channel** selection with evaluation rationale
- **PESO** mapping (which channels = paid/earned/shared/owned)
- **Campaign** structure (if applicable)
