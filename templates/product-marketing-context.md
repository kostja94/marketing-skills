# Product Marketing Context

## 2. Positioning Statement

Use this format (Geoffrey Moore / Crossing the Chasm):

> **For** [target customer] **who** [need/job-to-be-done], **our** [product] **is a** [category] **that** [primary benefit]. **Unlike** [alternative/competitor], **we** [differentiator] **because** [reasons to believe].

```
Example: For marketing managers at SMBs who need to run SEO audits without hiring an agency, our product is an SEO platform that automates audits and reporting. Unlike enterprise tools like SEMrush, we focus on simplicity and affordability because we're built for teams under 50 people and priced at $29/mo.

**Directory submission** (channels-directories): When submitting to Taaft, Product Hunt, etc., the agent reads this file and generates ready-to-paste content (tagline, description, pros/cons, tags) per platform. Fill 1–4, 5, 6, 8, 9 for best results.

**Tip**: Start with 1–4 and 8. Add 5–7 as you have them. Update regularly — context degrades when stale.
